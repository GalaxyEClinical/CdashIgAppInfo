### What is the CDASHIG V2.2 Standard?
The CDISC CDASH Team released Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization Implementation Guide for
Human Clinical Trials Version 2.2 on 2021/09/28 as a PDF.  

According to the CDISC CDASH Installation Guide:

"Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization (CDASH) establishes a standard way to collect data across studies.

The CDASH Model, the CDASH Implementation Guide (CDASHIG), and the CDASHIG metadata tables
define basic standards for collecting clinical trial data and how to implement the standard for specific case report forms (CRFs). 

Although the CDASH standard was originally developed for use in regulatory submissions, it can be used by any organization or individual involved in the collection, preparation, and analysis of clinical research data that may also be used for other purposes, including publication, warehousing, and meta-analyses. Data collection formats and structures provide clear traceability of submission data into the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM), delivering more transparency to regulators and others who conduct data reviews. The CDASH standard directly supports the production of clinical data collection instruments. Through this support, the standard also contributes to: 

Consistency and detail in representations of research protocol concepts
• Streamlined processes within medical research
• Development of a corporate library of standardized CRFs
• Use of metadata repositories
• Reporting and regulatory submission
• Data warehouse population
• Data archiving
• Post-marketing studies/safety surveillance."

### What is the CDISC 360 Vision?
360 is the CDISC initiative aimed at implementing standards as linked metadata with a conceptual foundation providing the additional semantics needed to support metadata driven-automation across the end-to-end clinical research data lifecycle.

New software tools will be able to consume this new metadata to ease standards implementations while increasing data processing efficiencies.

Standards-based metadata-driven automation is critical in realizing the primary benefits expected of the CDISC standards: substantially improved efficiency, consistency, and re-usability across the clinical research data lifecycle.
